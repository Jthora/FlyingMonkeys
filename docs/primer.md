App: Flying Monkeys

Real-time Anti-Narc Verbal Cognitive Warfare
Flow Chart Card Deck App (for Anti-Narc Family Disclosure Ops)

Flying Monkeys is a Card Game where A Single Player plays against a whole family of Narcissists, Flying Monkeys and their ring-leader Psychopath. The App has Cards and Flow Charts, Trap Cards, and you are trying to basically survive a Narcissistic Setup disguised as a "Family Intervention" where instead of them successfully family-diagnosing you as a Paranoid Schizophrenic, you prove to all the flying monkeys through demonstration that the Family is infested with demonic narcissists and a devil Psychopath.

Metaphor of gameplay: "We are trying to land this plane, but the whole family wants you to crash and burn so they can steal your inheritance.""

Tips:{
	Never EVER say "OK"
		(when they play a Trap Card, they are trying to get you to say "OK", NEVER say that EVER... or anything like that either. That is basically giving them Full Flight Path Control. Control the entire conversation to the very end until they finally stop engaging you. Once they stop engaging you and start ignoring you after you have completely Controlled the Flight Path: you win. Start a new game every time.)
	Always have another card to play.
		(never be caught, especially after the 4 second timeout, without a viable card to play. Don't keep talking, but if you're going to stop, always lay down 3 trap cards to lock them out of a DARVO Card, a Flying Monkey Card, and a Crocodile Tears Card)
	No One is going to Help You.
		(Assume the whole family is in on it. Everyone. They all know, they already knew, they talked and prepared and coached each other for strategy. They practiced for tactics. They all know, so there's no "getting them on your side", that's not how you win. There is only "making them afraid to engage anymore for fear of being cannibalized by the other narcissists")
	Someone is a Psychopath.
		(Assume someone in the family is not just a Covert/Overt Narcissist, but instead is a Full Blown Psychopath. Consider your own mother is absolutely a Covert Narcissist who DEFINITELY *NEEDS* you to be seen as Schizophrenic and will intentionally use only Mainstream Sources on purpose to discredit you. Your sources must be superior to their sources. You must always have a counter card for")
	Never say any "Conspiracy Theory" keywords
		(Conspiracy Theory Keywords will engage flying monkeys to quickly search using Mainstream Search Engines and provide the narcs with Flying Monkey Card support for a DARVO Triple Stack Combo.
	Never let them use your last card for a DARVO Triple Stack Combo
		(Always set them up properly with a flight path where they have to go out of their way to play a special card that puts them back into place to activate a DARVO Triple Stack Combo.)
	They are Religious and NOT Spiritual
		(You can ALWAYS beat them using belief in Angels and God, which they aren't allowed to dispute: MAJOR HACK. They WILL attack anything not-christian, especially astrology.)
	Never verbally make them all out to be the bad guys
		(They will IMMEDIATELY play their Hidden Trap Card that is ALWAYS available: by then proceeding to team up together as "Team Bad Guy" and now they can 'Crash Your Plane')
	Never engage when they try to use Mental Heath Concerns
		(They are trying to kill you using drugs and dismiss you as mentally insane or schizophenic. This is usually stacked with a Hidden Trap Card waiting for you to defend yourself, or worse: tricking you into trying to explain how Schizophenia Mental Disorder is fake and that there is a Conspiracy(which there is and the family is in on it by this point.). You can instead focus on Schizophenia Intelligence by playing an advanced Schizophenia Psychological Intelligence Card as a Counter )
	Never let the Narcissists get the opportunity to play a Discard Card
		(Being Discarded means you will never have their support again and will end up on the run and left out in the streets. You must ensure that you never fall for enough traps that they "Crash The Plane" and instead that you manage to maintain "Flight Path Control" until such a time where you successfully "Land The Plane")

Engagement Attack: "We'll, you gotta be ready for 'whatever they might try', because you never know.""
(...)[they intentionally pause here to plan out a psyop attack]
You need cards to play right after you say the engagement card or attack card—if you don't, they will gain the upper hand and play a trap card that brings them into narcissistic control.
if you instead play a follow up card, they won't be able to do that, and you can then force them into a specific flight path:{
	If they try to get back out of the flight path, your last-played follow up card will activate and you can then use a trap card.
	If they instead try to take control of the flight path, you can use another trap card instead, or another engagement card to further divert them off and into your desired flight path.
	If they choose to accept the flight path, now we can engage a truth card or activation card.

Times of Combos:{
	Triple Stack(3 cards that work well together that completely counter their ability to perform a Flight Path Highjack)
}

DARVO Detection:{
	Identify a Deny Cards/Reverse Cards/Victim Cards/Offender Cards
}

Timeout Detection:{
	You can see it in their eyes and the stare they give. They will activate it pre-emptively so identify it before you finish playing a card, so you can immediately tea up another card.
	Always have a Counter Timeout Card ready to go, otherwise they WILL steal Flight Path Control, and you will be on the defensive.(this is still relatively safe, until they deploy a Flying Monkey Card: at which point the game is likely a loss, even with a Counter Flying Monkey. Counter Flying Monkey can really only be played if they are on the defensive)
}

Gameplay Mechanics:{
	Flight Path Control — (making sure hostile family members don't manage to. Your goal is to maintain control and eventually dominate the flight path without them highjacking)
	Heat — (how frustrated and flustered have they made you: keep your cool, keep laughing, keep low deep calm tone, keep authoritative caidance. Making the narcissist more hot than you gives you the advantage in front of Flying Monkeys)
	4 Second Turns — (when you play specific cards, a Narcissist may play a Timeout Card to steal Flight Path Control or engage a Heat Card)
	Combos – (Cards can be stacked into combo sets that are effective at completely redirecting the conversation using a 3-Stack Card Set)
	Interupts - (Some cards can be Interupted, such as the Crocodile Tears Card(which if not Interupted WILL lead to an immediate Flight Path Highjack in the presence of Flying Monkeys))
	Traps - (Some cards can be used to setup traps for hostiles to fall into. Hostiles may also play trap cards which must be identified)
	Counters - Every Card can be Countered with another Card. Different cards require different Counters. Some Counters are very special and exist in theor own special category card type.

}(how to identify, and what cards are the best to use to counter?)

Prep Time Techniques:{
	Perform cyber investigations into real reports on government websites and have a button ready to go to auto-send to everyone in real time during the conversation so they have no prep-time.

"The T.I.'s name was on a will, but the family tried to steal it by killing off the designated sacrificial family member."(word that better and with alternate versions)

"Ritualistic Human Sacrifice"
"Paranoia is Justified when they really are out to get you"


This is an Aries-vs-Libra and Pisces-vs-Virgo battle.

"Belief and Honestly don't matter to them." (we are Aries/Pisces with a Taurus Core[Cusp of Power + Cusp of Rebirth])vs(they are Virgo/Libra with a Scorpio Core[Cusp of Criticism and Drama + Cusp of Beauty])

"You just sent this to us a minute ago"—"Yea, I had it ready just in case I had to have this conversation."(They WILL immediately play a Timeout Card: You MUST have a Counter Timeout Card ready immediately within 2 seconds to deploy for a successful Flight Path Domination move. This specific case will likely require a Triple Stack, as they will attempt a Flight Path Highjack if you only play a single )
"Because people have a hard time WANTING not to believe this. It's hard and emotionally scary for those who didn't know." (a Timeout Card will play followed by an Attack Card to lead into a hostile Triple Stack Reverse/Victim/Offender set followed by a Flying Monkey Card and/or a Crocodile Tears Card Double Stack)

Using a Calm Card + Interupt Card + Intelligence Card, a Crocodile Tears Card can be canceled mid-operation before the card-timeplay


"I win."(they will have that pause ... staring at you for a while. Will take longer than 4 seconds, don't let them reach the post 4-seconds mark: or you will totally loose flight path control)
"It's ok, I already won."
"Oh, that's just math. Universal Language can be proven mathematically using geometry. I was just noticing how it can relate to all of these other fields too."

You need to find EVERY conspiracy theory word and replace them with words that the Mainstream Searches either will not show anything, or back you up. NONE OF YOUR CARDS should have conspiracy keywords for you to say.

What happens if they reverse you on Federal Corruption and state that your posts are conspiracy theory or that "You said the government is corrupt so why would you trust them?"(because they saved my ass.(but is that me falling for a Hidden Trap Card?))
