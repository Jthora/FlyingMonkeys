# Flying Monkeys Field Manual

This folder is the playbook for the offline flow-chart card tool that keeps the targeted individual in command during faux interventions. Every document leans on the original `primer.md` voice: no backends, no telemetry, just a burner Android phone in airplane mode and the survivor holding the cards while the family fails to crash the plane.

## Quick Orientation
- **Start with `primer.md`** – raw intent and survival rules straight from the source.
- **Phase folders** sharpen that intent into actionable guides: vision, card libraries, HUD flows, engineering rituals.
- **All updates** assume sideloaded builds, manual backups, and survivor-owned data vaults.

## Phase Map
- **Phase 0 – Foundations:** `product-vision-mission-charter.md`, `counterplay-doctrine.md`, and other north-star documents that define the mission and offensive mindset.
- **Phase 1 – Experience:** Survival benchmarks, game design dossier, and card compendium focused on rapid counters and flow-chart dominance—no sanitization pipelines.
- **Phase 2 – UX & Content:** Ready Room/HUD specifications, offline content architecture, and motion language tuned for burner hardware and instant camouflage.
- **Phase 3 – Engineering:** Bare React Native stack ADR, security blueprint (duress PIN, panic wipe), sideload deployment ritual, and QA/field drill plans.

Each directory holds the authoritative docs for its focus area. When in doubt, cross-check with the primer to make sure any new copy or feature ideas keep the survivor’s control and offline autonomy intact.
