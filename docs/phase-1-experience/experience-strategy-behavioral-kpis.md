# Experience Strategy & Survival Benchmarks

## 1. Purpose
Translate the Phase 0 vision into the moment-by-moment experience a targeted individual needs: fast identification of hostile family moves, ruthless counter selection, and a clean exit. No telemetry, no remote coaching—just a tight loop between the player, the flow chart, and the deck.

## 2. Desired Player Outcomes
- **Immediate Recognition:** The player can tag the hostile card within four seconds of hearing it.
- **Counter Snap:** The player speaks the recommended counter without diluting the language.
- **Flight Path Control:** Conversation topics follow the player’s chosen sequence, not the family’s.
- **Receipt Precision:** Evidence comes out only when it will crack the room, never as a defensive ramble.
- **Confident Exit:** The player shuts down the encounter on his terms and walks away untagged.

## 3. Experience Pillars
1. **Flow-Chart First:** Every screen prioritizes “What did they just do?” and “What do I say next?”
2. **Offline Speed:** All assets, cards, and scripts load instantly with zero network dependency.
3. **Stealth Surface:** The interface sells the fiction of a competitive card game to any onlooker.
4. **Receipts On Tap:** Legal filings, timelines, and spiritual anchors are one swipe away, ready to slam on the table.
5. **Reset Rhythm:** Built-in breathing cues and calm cards keep delivery controlled without muting the message.

## 4. Survival Benchmarks (Manual Checks)
Instead of telemetry, the player (or a trusted ally) reviews these checkpoints after practice or live runs:

- **Branch Mastery:** Can you navigate each scenario branch without looking at tooltips? Practice until yes.
- **Combo Recall:** Can you recite the three-card lockdown chains from memory? If not, rehearse again.
- **Heat Control:** Did you keep your tone steady while they spiked? Note any slip and run the calm drill.
- **Trap Execution:** Did at least one trap corner them into contradicting themselves? Log the wording.
- **Exit Cleanliness:** Did you leave without promises, signatures, or “maybe later” statements? If not, rewrite the exit card.

These checks live as on-device scorecards the player can mark manually; no cloud copy exists.

## 5. Player Journey
1. **Pre-Flight Briefing**
   - Choose scenario branch (Discardation, Faux Intervention, etc.).
   - Review “Enemy Playbook” page outlining expected hostile cards.
   - Run a 60-second warm-up: breathe, visualize the room, select three go-to counters.
2. **Takeoff**
   - Immediately set the topic with an engagement card.
   - Load the first trap ready to spring when they overreach.
3. **Mid-Air Battle**
   - Family plays their rehearsed stack; player tags the card, selects the counter, and deploys within the four-second clock.
   - Use calm cards only to control heat, not to appease.
4. **Landing**
   - Once the room stalls, trigger the exit script, secure belongings, and leave.
5. **Debrief**
   - Record new phrases they used, update custom cards, and mark manual benchmarks.

## 6. Feedback Loop (Offline)
- **Practice Mode Notes:** App stores rehearsal outcomes locally so the player can reread them before the real ambush.
- **Field Journal:** After live sessions, the player can attach quick notes or audio (stored offline) to the branch they faced.
- **Manual Tweaks:** Deck editor lets the player rewrite card phrasing instantly based on what actually worked.

## 7. Risks & Countermeasures
| Risk | Impact | Counter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decision Freeze | Player hesitates and loses the four-second window | Timer pulses, prompts pre-selected fallback combo |
| Card Drift | Player edits cards to be polite and weakens them | Highlight original “iron” phrasing for reference |
| Device Seizure | Family grabs phone mid-session | Panic gesture flips to decoy deck; real deck locks behind PIN |
| Script Fatigue | Player forgets combos after long day | Quick rehearsal mode: 10 random prompts before confrontation |

## 8. Implementation Notes
- No automated tracking beyond local scorecards; everything stays on-device.
- Use simple JSON logs for branch notes so the player can export manually if desired.
- Provide printable cheat sheets for those who want analog backups.

## 9. Open Decisions
- Do we ship with audio cues or rely solely on visuals to preserve stealth?
- How many manual benchmark templates should be included out of the box?
- Can we support multi-device ownership (tablet + phone) while keeping transfers offline?

## 10. Revision Rhythm
- Update whenever new hostile tactics show up in field notes.
- Keep a plain-text changelog appended to this document for the player’s records.
