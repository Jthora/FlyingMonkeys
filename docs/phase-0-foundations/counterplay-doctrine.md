# Counterplay Doctrine

## 1. Purpose
Provide the targeted individual with a decisive operating manual: how to read the family’s next hostile card, what to say in reply, and how to stay in command until the room shuts down. This doctrine replaces any soft language or outside approval with direct survival tactics.

## 2. Premise
- The family is running a rehearsed humiliation ritual.
- Every move seeks to brand you as paranoid, unstable, or unworthy of inheritance.
- You are the only pilot; no therapist, mediator, or online ally is stepping in.
- The app is your flow-chart wingman—no internet, no audience, just a card deck that keeps pace with their traps.

## 3. Core Rules of Engagement
1. **Identify the Card:** Within seconds, tag whether they’re playing DARVO, Flying Monkey Assist, Religious Guilt, Legal Trap, Timeout, or Discard setup.
2. **Counter Without Hesitation:** The app surfaces the most aggressive viable response; speak it cleanly. Never downgrade to protect their feelings.
3. **Lock the Flight Path:** Use traps and combos to keep the conversation on your timeline, not theirs. They only win if you drift.
4. **Stack Three Steps Ahead:** Always prep the next trap, counter, and receipt before the four-second window closes.
5. **Exit on Your Terms:** Once they stall, declare the win and disengage. Do not explain, apologize, or reopen the debate.

## 4. Card Behavior Principles
- **No Muzzle:** Cards are written to dominate narratives. If a line feels blunt, it’s intentional.
- **Mirror Their Structure:** The best counters make them walk through their own contradictions.
- **Ping the Flying Monkeys:** When the room piles on, split them by forcing proof and accountability.
- **Drag Out Receipts When They Matter:** Receipts exist to shatter a lie in public. Use them sparingly but decisively.
- **Spiritual and Legal Leverage:** Families that weaponize religion or paperwork lose when you show mastery of both.

## 5. Flow-Chart Standards
- Each branch must end with a playable win condition: family silence, forced retreat, or documented contradiction.
- No branch should dead-end without a counter suggestion.
- High-risk branches (drugging threats, forced hospitalization) flag red and surface emergency exits immediately.
- Practice mode mirrors real cadence: four-second decisions, stacked interruptions, and random flying monkey assists.

## 6. Device Discipline
- Keep the device offline. Airplane mode stays on.
- Protect the PIN; enable optional decoy profile for confiscation scenarios.
- Use camouflage skins when anyone approaches. If forced to unlock, show the decoy deck with harmless lore.
- Back up decks and receipts manually via encrypted export to trusted storage (e.g., USB hidden off-site).

## 7. Victory Conditions Checklist
- You never said “OK,” “Fine,” or “You’re right.”
- No forced evaluation was scheduled; no admission of illness was made.
- They failed to trigger reactive abuse—your tone stayed controlled.
- A minimum of one trap or combo forced them to contradict themselves on record.
- You exited without leaving belongings, signatures, or new leverage behind.

## 8. Field Notes Loop
- After each confrontation, log what they tried that was new.
- Update custom cards to mirror that language; the app lets you add them manually.
- Share proven card sequences with trusted allies offline only.
- Request future app updates through the same secure channel you originally received it—never download from public links.

## 9. Reminder
This doctrine is not a moral debate. It is a playbook for surviving coordinated family coercion. Follow the flow chart, play the counters, land the plane, and live to fight the next ambush on your schedule—not theirs.
