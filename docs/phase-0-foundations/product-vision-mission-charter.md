# Product Vision & Mission Charter

## 1. Purpose
Anchor Flying Monkeys as a purely offline, single-player survival instrument that walks a targeted individual through every hostile move their narcissistic family will attempt during a staged intervention.

## 2. Problem Statement
A targeted individual is ambushed by relatives who want public proof that he is “schizophrenic,” unstable, or unworthy of inheritance. The family rehearses humiliation rituals, flying monkey assists, and legal traps designed to corner him into reactive abuse or forced treatment. There is no reliable way—paper, therapist, or coach—to keep pace with the onslaught in real time. The player needs an immediate-response flow-chart that predicts the family’s next card and tells him exactly what to say to regain control.

## 3. Vision Statement
Deliver a covert card deck console that says, “Pick the move you’re being hit with right now, and here’s the counter that locks out their combo.” The tool should run without a signal, resemble a high-stakes card game to every onlooker, and keep the player guiding the conversation until the family gives up.

## 4. Mission Statement
Create an always-offgrid experience that:
- Maps every common humiliation path a narcissistic family will run.
- Lets the player tag the current hostile card in seconds and surfaces the correct response stack.
- Keeps all logic, receipts, and notes encrypted locally—no servers, no telemetry, no sync.
- Presents as a game so snooping relatives see nothing actionable.
- Ends sessions with a victory script the player can use to disengage without ceding ground.

## 5. Strategic Objectives
1. **Total Flow Visibility:** Lay out every hostile branch as a tappable flow chart so no tactic feels surprising.
2. **Instant Counter Selection:** Provide ready-to-speak counter cards with phrasing tuned for domination, not appeasement.
3. **Narrative Control:** Show how to redirect the room toward verifiable truth, inheritance law, and spiritual leverage while denying the “schizophrenic” label.
4. **Stealth Layer:** Maintain plausible deniability with card art, lore, and optional camouflage skins.
5. **Offline Resilience:** Guarantee full functionality without internet, accounts, or remote updates.

## 6. Success Indicators
- Player reports staying in control or forcing a stalemate in live confrontations.
- Player completes flow-chart rehearsals for every family archetype before the real ambush.
- Player exits sessions without agreeing to evaluations, drugs, or conceding inheritance rights.
- Player keeps the device secure; no cloud footprint or shareable logs exist for the family to seize.

## 7. Operating Principles
- **Aggressive Defense:** Cards should not soften language for the aggressors. Give the player the strongest viable counters.
- **Manual Mastery:** No AI, no online lookup, no waiting—every counter is preloaded and accessible in under four taps.
- **Single Source of Truth:** Flow charts, card decks, and receipts live in one local vault.
- **Stealth by Design:** The interface must pass a casual inspection as a hobby game.
- **Iterate via Field Notes:** Future refinements come from real confrontation diaries, not remote analytics.

## 8. Scope Boundaries
### In Scope
- Solo play focused on faux interventions and discard rituals.
- Card libraries covering DARVO, flying monkey, legal trap, religious guilt, and psych bait plays.
- Flow-chart rehearsal mode with timers that mimic real cadence.
- Local vault for receipts, legal docs, and verbal scripts.

### Out of Scope
- Online accounts, matchmaking, or cloud backups.
- Server-driven updates, telemetry, or remote content pushes.
- Tone-policing or ethics filters that weaken counter cards.
- Coaching aggressors or providing tools for narcissistic training.

## 9. Assumptions
- The player controls the device, can keep it hidden, and charges it privately.
- Updates, if any, are sideloaded manually via trusted channels (e.g., USB).
- The team building the app is comfortable with TypeScript/React Native but stays within offline boundaries.
- Real-world survivor feedback drives future card additions.

## 10. Roadmap Snapshot
1. **Phase 0 – Foundations:** Capture vision, player persona, hostile archetype catalog (done).
2. **Phase 1 – Experience:** Draft flow charts, card taxonomy, and decisive scripting.
3. **Phase 2 – UX & Content:** Build HUD wireframes, card data structures, and on-device vault model.
4. **Phase 3 – Engineering:** Assemble the offline app, encryption layer, and sideloadable packages.
5. **Phase 4 – Operations:** Document manual update process, field feedback loops, and camouflage refresh cadence.

## 11. Open Questions
- Which flow-chart branches should ship first: Faux Intervention or Discard ritual?
- What is the minimal device spec we must support for smooth animations offline?
- How many receipts should the base build include versus user-imported evidence?
- What wording keeps the victory script strong while still sounding casual to eavesdroppers?

## 12. Revision Plan
- Update after every major round of live-session feedback.
- Track changes in repository history; keep a simple changelog at document bottom.
- No quarterly bureaucracy—revise when new hostile tactics surface.
